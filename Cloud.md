### Resources Groups-
- is a container to manage and aggregte resources in a single unit.
- can exist in only one resources group.
- can exist in different regions.
- can be moved to different resources groups.
- applications can utilize multiple resource groups.
### Azure Resources Manager
- Provides a managemant layer that enables you to create,update and delete resources in your azure subscriptions
### Azure Subscriptions 
- An azure subs. provides you with authenticated and authorized access to azure accounts.
